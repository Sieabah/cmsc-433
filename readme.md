## CMSC433 Project 1

This readme file will explain how this project is organized, but not anything in detail about how the application is
setup or run. Please consult the readme inside the proj1 folder for that data.

This project uses Debian Linux, Apache, PHP5.6, and MySQL for it's web technologies. Underneath it uses VirtualBox and
Vagrant for development. Provided in this folder is a Vagrantfile that will setup a virtual machine with this website
available at 192.168.33.10. You can visit and use the website with no problems.

If you would like to manually setup the website you can look at the other readme file in the project folder.
